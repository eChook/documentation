# Build Instructions

In its simplest form, building the board consists of soldering all components in their correct places, as shown in the table below.

To make the process of soldering the board as easy as possible, itâ€™s best to start with the smallest components first. All components sit on the top of the board, none on the bottom. The bottom of the board has the eChook logo and board version number printed on it, the top has hte component outline and values.

High resolution photos of a finished board can be found [here](https://goo.gl/photos/QLNfrek9v2v522xa9). Note that this is a slightly earlier board where the bluetooth wires are soldered directly to the board instead of connected via a header. Also the components appearance may differ slightly to those supplied in the kits, as the suppliers may change between manufacturing runs.

### Video Instructions

Once the board is fully populated there will be a few components remaining. These are the sensors that fit to the car. Your kit may also have a few spare components.

Pin-outs for the connectors on the eChook can be found in the 'Connecting the eChook to the car' section of the documentation.
