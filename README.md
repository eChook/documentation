# Welcome to eChook

Welcome to the documentation for the eChook nano board and the eChook Android app.

The eChook is a data logging and telemetry system tailored towards electric cars competing in the Greenpower race series. It consists of an Arduino based PCB sold through the Greenpower online store and an \(Android Only\) app that displays and logs the data. If the phone has a data connection it can also push the data to cloud services enabling real time telemetry from the car to the pits - or anywhere with an internet connection!

If anything is unclear or you get stuck, pop us a message on the forum or with the little message icon in the bottom right of the page and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

## The idea behind eChook

The original eChook nano board and the eChook Companion app came about because of a need for data display and logging on the Driven and weChook racing cars.

We realised that this is also an area that many teams do not have the time or knowledge to implement themselves, and where available solutions off the shelf tend to be expensive, limited in their inputs and ‘black boxes’ where signal goes in and data comes out.

We wanted to build a greenpower specific data logging and telemetry system that had inputs tailored to the need of a greenpower car, but also used simple circuits that can be understood by students at GCSE and A level to promote an understanding of how the whole system works, rather than being a ‘black box’ solution. As well as this we aim to keep the price as low as possible to fit within the budgets of Greenpower teams!

To this aim we are not taking a profit from the boards - if we break even and greenpower teams benefit from lots of race data, we’ll call that a win. Now that kits are entering production and being sold through Greenpower, 100% of the profits go back to Greenpower.

## The Team

The team behind the eChook consists of Ian Cooper and Rowan Griffin. We are ex-Driven team members who are too old to race in F24+ but can’t quite pull ourselves away from Greenpower.

We have worked on all aspects of the eChook, but predominantly Ian has worked on circuit and PCB Design, Rowan has worked on the Arduino software, documentation, support and Android App.

## Support

While this documentation aims to make building and using the eChook as easy as possible, there will always be cases where something doesn't go as expected and some help is needed. eChook has both a forum and in browser messaging that anyone can use to ask questions and discuss anything eChook, electronics, or greenpower in general.

They are both monitored by the eChook team who will get back to any questions as quickly as possible.

## Feedback

We really appreciate and try to act upon any feedback we get. Each page has a quick good/ok/bad quick feedback at the bottom, which is useful, however doesn't tell us the reason! If you feel a page can be improved, drop us a message \(icon bottom right of screen\) and let us know - We'll say thanks I promise!

\(For instance this page gets consistently bad ratings but I don't know why so don't know what to add/remove!\)
