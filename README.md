# Welcome to the eChook nano documentation

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the [Omni Telemetry ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.keduro.omni)app (Courtesy of Banchory Greenpower Team) is now the recommended app to use with all variants of the eChook nano.

See [Using the App](using-the-app/) section for more information.

The eChook nano is a data logging and telemetry system tailored towards electric cars competing in the Greenpower race series. It consists of an Arduino based PCB sold through the Greenpower online store and an (Android Only) app that displays and logs the data. If the phone has a data connection it can also push the data to cloud services enabling real time telemetry from the car to the pits - or anywhere with an internet connection!

## The idea behind eChook GPT

The original eChook Nano board and the eChook app was developed because of a need for data display and logging in our own Greenpower racing teams - the JLR 'Driven' team and the weChook racing team.

Having solid data on a car's performance is incredibly important, both during the race for strategy decisions and for analysis after the race to analyze performance and inform vehicle development. It's also an area that many Greenpower teams do not have the time or knowledge to implement themselves, and where available off-the-shelf solutions tend to be expensive, limited in their inputs and ‘black boxes’ where signal goes in and data comes out.

We have designed a Greenpower specific data logging and telemetry system that has inputs specific to the needs of a Greenpower car, but also uses simple circuits that align with the GCSE and A level Electronics curriculum to promote an understanding of how the whole system works, rather than being a ‘black box’ solution.&#x20;

## Support

While this documentation aims to make understanding, building and using the eChook as easy as possible, there will always be cases where something doesn't go as expected and some help is needed. eChook has both a forum and in browser messaging that anyone can use to ask questions and discuss anything eChook, electronics, or Greenpower in general.

They are monitored by the eChook team who will get back to any questions as quickly as possible.

## Feedback

We really appreciate and try to act upon any feedback we get. Each page has quick good/ok/bad feedback buttons at the bottom, which is useful, however doesn't tell us the reason! If you feel a page can be improved, drop us a message (icon bottom right of screen) and let us know - We'll say thanks I promise!

(For instance this page gets consistently bad ratings but I don't know why so don't know how to improve it!)&#x20;
