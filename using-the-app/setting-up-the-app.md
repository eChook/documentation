# Setting up the App

The app needs a little configuring before it is ready to log data. Open the app and go into the Settings menu.

First select which bluetooth device to log data from. Tap ‘Select Bluetooth Device’ and select the eChook you just paired from the list:

Now enter the car name. This will be added to the log files.

If the car is running gears, enter the number of teeth on the motor sprocket and the number of teeth on each gear on the wheel side. The app will calculate the possible gear ratios and try to identify and log which the car is running on. If the RPM and speed data is too noisy or too low resolution, this feature may not work very well.

While you are here you can enable Location tracking, which will enable logging of GPS speed, location and altitude and is needed in order for the app to detect laps.
