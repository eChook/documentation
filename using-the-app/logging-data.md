## Logging Data

Once set up, press the blue connect bluetooth button. If successful, a notification will confirm this across the top of the screen and logging will start automatically, shown by a green tick next to the ‘save’ icon in the top right of the screen. Note: The size of the logfile shown on screen will only update once logging is stopped.
