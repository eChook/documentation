## Pair the phone to the eChook

Ensure the eChook board is powered, and the bluetooth module plugged in. The LED on the Bluetooth module should be blinking, indicating it is ready to receive a connection.

Enter the bluetooth settings on the Android phone \(system settings, not within the eChook app\). Scan for new devices. The HC-05 module should show up, although it can be slow to resolve the name and show as a MAC address in the form of XX.XX.XX.XX for a while. This should eventually change to the name you specified in the configuration.h file. Pair with the it using the passcode “1234”.
