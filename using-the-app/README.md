# Using the App

There are two app options for the eChook - the **eChook app** and a new offering from the Banchory Greenpower team, **OMNI Telemetry**. Development on the eChook app has been falling behind a bit, and  the Banchory Team have very kindly stepped up and offered their app to all teams as an alternative. Both apps log the data locally, and allow uploading the data to the eChook live data website.

Unless you have a reason to use the eChook app, the current recommendation is to use the new OMNI app.

A quick comparison:

A huge thanks to Keith and the Banchory team for sharing their app!

#### Installing the OMNI Telemetry app

Onmi Telemetry is available from the Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.keduro.omni\&hl=en\_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.keduro.omni\&hl=en_GB)

#### Installing the eChook app

The eChook app is no longer on the play store.&#x20;

As a lot of teams use older phones for the app we have always kept it at the lowest API level allowed by the play store. This has now come back to bite us as the play store requirements have jumped, and the changes needed to the app to bring it back up to compliance are quite major. If further development occurs on the app it will be provided as a downloadable APK.

Please use the download from [APKPure](https://apkpure.com/echook/com.ben.drivenbluetooth), and follow their [installation instructions](https://apkpure.com/how-to/how-to-install-xapk-apk).
