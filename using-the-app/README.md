# Using the App

This section covers everything involved in setting up and using the Android app.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that the eChook app is no longer available on the Google Play store. It can now be download from here: [https://apkpure.com/echook/com.ben.drivenbluetooth](https://apkpure.com/echook/com.ben.drivenbluetooth)

This is temporary - apologies for the inconvenience!
{% endhint %}

#### No More Play Store!

As a lot of teams use older phones for the app we have always kept it at the lowest API level allowed by the play store. This has now come back to bite us as the play store requirements have jumped, and the changes needed to the app to bring it back up to compliance are quite major. It will be remedied and return to the play store in due course. Until then, please use the download from [APKPure](https://apkpure.com/echook/com.ben.drivenbluetooth), and follow their [installation instructions](https://apkpure.com/how-to/how-to-install-xapk-apk).
