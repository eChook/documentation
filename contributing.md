# Contributing

eChook is an open source project and we welcome contributions!

Our current focus is redoing the android app and improving the website and live data display. The new app  is being coded with Flutter and Dash, and the eChook server is written in nodeJS. Both will soon have repositories on the eChook github page https://github.com/echook. If you want to contribute drop us a message or a pull request.

The only big of code we are reluctant to change is the arduino code for the echook. It needs to remain compatible with all versions of eChook board and easy to read. We'll happily consider any pull requests in line with that. Any work that adds features or functionality won't be merged into the main branch, but we would love to link to it in the readme, or possibly add it to a feature branch in the repository.
