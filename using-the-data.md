# Using the Data

Itâ€™s time to get the data off the phone and onto a computer for some useful analysis.

#### Retrieving data from phone

In the eChook app settings, the top option is to share data. Tap this to display a list of ways to send the data file to via service you wish. 

Data is saved in a .csv file in the phone's downloads folder so can also be retrieved via a file manager app, or via a USB connection to a computer.
