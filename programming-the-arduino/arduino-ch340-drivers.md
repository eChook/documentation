# Arduino CH340 Drivers

The Arduino Compatible Nano included in the kit\* requires a driver to be installed that isn't included with the Arduino IDE.



Sparkfun have written an excellent installation guide, however ensure you download the drivers directly from sparkfun, not the WCH website. There is a bug in the newer (2019) version of the drivers from the WCH Website.

Or download the drivers directly (still via sparkfun) [here.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn\_tutorials/8/4/4/CH341SER.EXE)

During the install process, check the driver date - the 2014 drivers work, later ones have been known to cause issues.

Once drivers are installed continue to the next page.

\* During the chip shortage in 2022 some kits were supplied with Genuine Arduino Nano Every boards - if you have one of these kits you can skip this step, the drivers were installed with the Arduino IDE.
