# Download the eChook Arduino Code

There are two aspects to the eChook code - the code itself, and any code libraries that the main code references. The eChook code is dependant on one library called ‘Bounce2’ which is used to debounce the switch inputs.

## Downloading Libraries

Download the Bounce2 library with the built in Arduino IDE libraries manager:&#x20;

If the install button isn't visible, you may need to make the app fullscreen or enlarge the side panel.

The bounce 2 library is used in the eChook code to debounce button inputs.
