## Free Telemetry

Any data sent through the free telemetry is available for anyone online to see. We have taken the caution of not allowing location data to be transmitted, but it also means that there is a chance for other teams to see your data. We have decided not to transmit location over the free telemetry, as we do not want to be responsible for publicly uploading anyone’s location! It is not intended to incentivise paying for the pro version \(we don’t benefit financially from that anyway\), although it may have that effect.

The eChook app will send data to a dweet channel \(dweet calls it a ‘Thing’\), with an ID of your choosing. Anyone with this ID can watch your data, and every free data stream is available to see at[dweet.io/see](https://dweet.io/see). To avoid your information being identified, a random ID can be used - other teams will still be able to identify it as eChook data from its contents, but identifying which team it belongs to will be more difficult.

A website to display this data nicely is[freeboard.io](https://freeboard.io/). You create a dashboard and can share the link to it with anyone you want to be able to share the live data feed with.

### Setting up free telemetry

First, enter the eChook app and go to settings. Enter a thing ID of your choosing to the ‘dweet Thing name’ field. If you want a random ID a good random generator can be found [here](https://www.random.org/strings/). Now enable the ‘Enable Live Data’ setting in the app.

Go to freeboard.io and create a free account. You can now set up your dashboard from scratch, or make a clone of one we have made here: [https://freeboard.io/board/081s7W](https://freeboard.io/board/081s7W).

Follow the tutorial if you are making your own dashboard. If you are adapting ours, you need to change it to use your thing ID. Click on the ‘weChookOpen’ data source and the following dialog will appear:

You should now have a dashboard showing your data. The site doesn’t work so well on mobile devices, but improves if you request the desktop site.

**NOTE** - freeboard is currently in beta and we’ve found a couple of bugs. Notably all the data panes tend to rearrange themselves when you reload. Occasionally they begin to overlap themselves - going into the panels settings, changing the number of columns wide it is, save, move it, change it back to the original width, and generally it works...... I did warn you it’s in beta!
