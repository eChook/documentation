# Node-Red Integration

The data send to dweet.io can be accessed from lots of other systems. One that might be of particular interest to Greenpower teams is Node-Red. This is a scratch style, drag and drop programming tool that comes pre-installed on Raspberry Pi's.

Node Red can be used to capture the dweet.io data, perform any calculations on it, and even create your own dashboard to present the data as you want. You will need to add a dweet.io plugin to the palette. This provides you with a dweet.io input node. Configure this with your 'thing name' and it will output all the data being uploaded from your phone.
