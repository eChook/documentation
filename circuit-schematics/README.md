# Circuit Schematics

This section explains the circuits on the PCB and how each signal is adapted to one that the Arduino can read. The full schematic is shown below.

If you're building a kit this section is purely here if you're curious how it works - you've already soldered all of these components in place in the 'Build Instructions' section.
